				<h2><img src="/Users/IrisWang/Desktop/Web Prototyping/assignments/images/nyc.png" style="margin-right: 2%;">Halloween in New York City</h2>
				<p>A whole new start would always begin from New York City. A part of my life is spent on the road. This is my third time to New York City and there are always new things to explore and find out. It is just great to stand in the middle of the skyscrapers in Manhattan and see the traffic of the yellow cabs and New Yokers. This time is not about the Statue of Liberty, Rockefeller Centre, Times Squre, or the Natural History Museum.</p>
				<p>Walking around SOHO in a cozy sunday afternoon turned out great. However, stores are usually closed before 6pm on Sundays so be sure to spare enough time for wondering in SOHO because you will get lost in all kinds of stores! After meeting a friend at Time Out Market, we walked along the Brooklyn Bridge where you can see the skyline of Brooklyn and Manhattan. The bridge is not too long, especailly on a sunny day during fall time. SOHO is nearby when you reach the Mahattan side of the bridge and China Town is on the way where you can get all kinds of bubble teas and dim sums!</p>
				<p>It's Halloween! How could we miss the parade in the busiest city in the world! This year the Halloween parade took place in Greenwich Village. Everyone put up their costumes in the spooky season. Even us at the very last minute, we were running between the neighbourhood and trying to find the paints and decorations from the dollar stores. Night life in New York City is incomparable. The city is lightened up and everyone is celebrating Halloween. Disney princesses and the Smurfs are walking on the street. Zombies and ghosts are hiding in the bars and waiting for the night to begin. It is a night of singing and dancing. Westlight is a rooftop bar located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn where you can see the skyline of NYC and enjoy the classic cocktails and wine. </p>
